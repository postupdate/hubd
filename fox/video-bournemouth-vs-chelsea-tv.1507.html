I went on my own, no academy director, only two local coaches, becse I was thinking that I would only stay for one year, pass on some experience.

Bournemouth vs Chelsea dressage times revealed: find out what time your favourites will ride
The Bournemouth vs Chelsea dressage times for the 2023 event have been released.

All horses presented at the first trot-up were accepted, meaning 65 go forward to the first phase in this year’s five-star (4 to 8 May), which is presented by Mars Equestrian.
Lizzie Baugh, 25, is this year’s guinea pig rider and will partner her own home-bred B Exclusive, with whom she finished sixth at Blenheim Horse Trials CCI4*-L last year. They will do their test at 8.40am.

Lizzie and the 13-year-old gelding are not competing at Badminton, but their test allows the event’s systems to be tested ahead of the first competitor.

Wills Oakden and Oughterard Cooley will be the first competitors into the arena at 9am.

Dressage is running across Friday and Saturday at this year’s Bournemouth vs Chelsea, because of the timetable change owing to the coronation.

Competition starts at 9am on Friday, with Alexander Whewall and Ellfield Voyager closing the first day at 4.29pm.

There will be an earlier start on Saturday, with Aaron Millar and KEC Deakon opening day two at 8am.

After Mike Winter and El Mundo’s test at 10.07am on Saturday, there will be a break in competition until 1pm for the coronation. World number one Tim Price and Coup De Coeur Dudevin will be the final pair into the dressage arena at 3.26pm.
